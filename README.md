# Welcome to Willem's Github Page

Hi, I am a currently studying for my M.S. in Health Informatics with concentration in Data Analytics.

Some of my skills include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Tableau

### Take a look at some projects I have done.

Here is one of my semester projects:
(https://github.com/Yoozernaym/healthinsurancePlotlyDash/blob/master/app.py)
I made this to practice Python and to learn data visualization with Plotly Dash.

I also attempted to remake this project using D3js to practice with JavaScript.
