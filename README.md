Hi, I am a currently studying for my M.S. in Health Informatics with concentration in Data Analytics.

Some of my skills include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Tableau

### Take a look at some projects I have done.

- [PlotlyDash](https://github.com/Yoozernaym/healthinsurancePlotlyDash/blob/master/app.py)
- [D3js](https://yoozernaym.github.io/healthinsuranceD3js/)

 
The first is one of my semester projects, I made it to practice Python and to learn data visualization with Plotly Dash. 
I also attempted to remake this project using D3js to practice with JavaScript. 

I am open to any job opportunities related to Health Informatics/Data Analysis.
