Some of my skills include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Tableau

### Take a look at some projects I have done.

- [PlotlyDash](https://github.com/Yoozernaym/healthinsurancePlotlyDash/blob/master/app.py)
- [D3js](https://yoozernaym.github.io/healthinsuranceD3js/)

 
The first is one of my semester projects, I made it to practice Python and to learn data visualization with Plotly Dash. 
I also attempted to remake this project using D3js to practice with JavaScript.
