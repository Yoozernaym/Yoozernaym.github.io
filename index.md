Hi, I am a currently studying for my M.S. in Health Informatics with concentration in Data Analytics.

Some of my skills include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel

### Take a look at some projects I have done.

- [HealthInsurancePlotlyDash](https://github.com/Yoozernaym/healthinsurancePlotlyDash/blob/master/app.py)
- [HealthInsuranceD3js](https://yoozernaym.github.io/healthinsuranceD3js/)

 
The first is one of my semester projects, I use Python to retrieve health insurance data from the U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Health Insurance Estimates API at [Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Health-Insurance-Statistics.html) and use the [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) Python library for data visualization in various charts and a data table in a single page application.

The second is my attempt to remake this project using D3js to practice with JavaScript. 

I am open to any job opportunities related to Health Informatics/Data Analysis. I am also open to job opportunities related to development with Python or JavaScript, I am very willing and eager to learn new things as well.
